              This project aims to develop SL Glove, an AI-powered wearable system designed to enable real-time communication between hearing and speech-impaired individuals and others.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Combining sensor-based gesture recognition with machine-learning-driven translation, SL Glove converts Turkish Sign Language (Tƒ∞D) into text and natural speech through a mobile application, while also translating voice input back into visual animations for the user.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The goal is to create an accessible, low-latency, and cost-effective communication solution that bridges the gap between sign language and spoken language.
